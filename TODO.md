# authlocal todo
- [ ] rework dehydrateIdentities signature, use rest param
- [ ] consider adding a dedicated "edit passport" flow -- instead of logging in, you jump straight to editing and re-logging-in
- [ ] improved story about how the ui behaves when tokens expire
- [ ] users (not devs) can choose how long to authorize an app (1-hour, 24-hours, 7-days)
